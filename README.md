## �📖 Overview
**Logger** is a lightweight, thread-safe diagnostics utility wrapping Apple's `OSLog`. It provides structured logging without the performance penalty of `print()`.

---

## ⚡️ Features
-   **Subsystem Partitioning**: Automatically categorizes logs by Package (`com.canvas.store`, `com.canvas.trainer`).
-   **Privacy Redaction**: Respects OS-level privacy settings for sensitive data.
-   **Zero Overhead**: Compiled out in Release builds where appropriate.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```swift
import Logger

let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.canvas.ui", category: "View")
logger.debug("View loaded", metadata: ["time": 0.5])
```
